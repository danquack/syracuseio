A casual meetup based around developer side-projects. OpenHack Syracuse happens on the second tuesday of every month at Syracuse Coworks.

We welcome local developers and designers of all skill levels, interests, ages genders, you-name-it to get together to write code or push pixels. Weâ€™ll provide good food, good people, and creative energy.
