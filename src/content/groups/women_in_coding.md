Women in Coding will be hosting workshop style classes once a month every
second Saturday of the month, from 10am-12pm at The Tech Garden!

Rather than having an instructor teach a specific topic, these workshops
will give you the chance to work on a project or work through an online
curriculum at your own pace. Never coded before? No problem. We'll help
get you started. Each workshop will have at least one mentor there to provide
support and answer questions.

Although this group is geared towards women, anyone is welcome to attend
our classes.
